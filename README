Udanax Green + Pyxi + .mpe hacks
Berend van Berkum <berend@dotmpe.com>

Xu88.1 is found at http://udanax.com/green/. There are two interactive parts to
this project, ``backend``, and ``xumain``. The former is a executable binary
to run a server for one Xanadu Green Enfilade, loaded from ``*.enf``. The
structure is interacted with by the Xu88.1 FeBe (Frontend-Backend) protocol over 
port 55146.
The ``xumain`` executable serves to interact with a BeBe (Backend-Backend)
protocol but seems mostly usefull for creating new enfilades.
A FeBe client is implemented by ``pyxi``, a Python/Tk script which provides an 
editable text-view and text highlighting and linking.

My hacks include:

- x-be-pipestream-tcpwrapper.py, circumvent bug and have single user network
  access.
- udxdot, create dot network diagrams for nodes/links
- htdoc with some tools to generate and backup enfilades
- XuDiff - handle simple remove/insertions.. muse on rearrangements. Plain text
  editor FeBe adapter based on standard file diffs.
