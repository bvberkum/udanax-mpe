This is by Udanax Green convention the link page. Links made in this document
represent the different link types, the following are in use by Pyxi/Udanax Green:

 1.1.0.1.0.2.0.2.1 Jump
 1.1.0.1.0.2.0.2.2 Quote
 1.1.0.1.0.2.0.2.3 Footnote
 1.1.0.1.0.2.0.2.4 Margin

These link types are link ids themselves. To bootstrap an Undanax Green enfilade,
the following command is issued four times:

    27~0.1.1.0.1.0.2~
    1~v~0.1.1.0.1.0.2~1~0.1.1~1.1~
    1~v~0.1.1.0.1.0.2~1~0.1.1~1.1~
    1~v~0.1.1.0.1.0.2~1~0.1.1~1.1~

creating the first 4 link types. The end-sets used for these are all the same,
spanning the first character of this document.

    <SpecSet [<VSpec in 1.1.0.1.0.2, at 1.1 for 0.1>]>

or stated the same using x88.py::

    SpecSet(VSpec(Address("1.1.0.1.0.2"), Span(Address("1.1"), Address("1.2"))))
